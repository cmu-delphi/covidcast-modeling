# Google COVID-19 Search Trends Exploration

To reduce confusion, we should not use the term "GHT" for the new dataset - 
both to distinguish the new source from the old GHT source, and also 
because the new dataset is not called "GHT" by Google -- formally, it
is called the "COVID-19 Search Trends symptoms dataset".  I propose the
name "Google Symptoms" for our own DELPHI-internal use.
