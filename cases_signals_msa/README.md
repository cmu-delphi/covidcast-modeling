# Exploring Signals as Potential Leading Indicators of Cases in MSAs

Writeup from [DAPs Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a47TPdhvGPXWkD6hrX_16hhmcTaIMVUxIs57UZ5MOh4/edit):

"Select a bunch of metro areas that had outbreaks at different time points. Align their time series at, say, the first day with over 100 cases, or something like that. Plot together. In adjacent plots, plot our other signals aligned in the same way, so we can see which signals precede the peaks consistently, how much they precede the peaks, and so on."
