## Goals and Research Questions

Mobility trends: Historically, did mobility patterns change as a result of government interventions? (Appears on mission statement)

1. Plot the SafeGraph mobility signals across time in a few locations that have had various restrictions. The COVIDcast map seems to suggest these signals donâ€™t vary much; do we see anything interesting in the plots?
2. As college semesters start up, pick out a few college towns with mostly student populations (like College Station, TX, or Oxford, OH) and graph surveys, cases, mobility, etc. to see what happened when students returned.
3. Need to deal with confounding by case counts (behavioral responses to # of cases/deaths)
