# Mobility, Government Intervention, and Potential Confounders

## Goals and Research Questions

Mobility is one of the potential factors in contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Our goal is to estimate the effect of state-wide policies on mobility signals at a county-level in this work to answer the following questions: 

  * Do mobility signals decrease more because of the governemnt interventions or public reaction to case counts?

  * Once we can measure the effects of governemnt interventions on mobility, can we rank the effectiveness of the interventions at a county level?

  * Can we characterize different counties based on the known effects of the governemnt interventions on mobility?

  * Do mandatory policies seem to be more effective than recommended policies in reducing mobility?

## Conclusion and future work

Based on assumptions, we have found that state-wide government interventions tend to have a larger effect in reducing mobility in the areas with a large population, a small percentage of people in poverty, a high percent of people with education backgrounds, and a low unemployment rate. 

Secondly, recommended polcies, gathering restriction and school closure, may not have a sigificant effect in reducing mobility, whereas some mandatory policies such as public masks and business closures have a significant effect on mobility in California counties. We rank the effectiveness of the intervention on mobility in terms of the regression coefficient in a linear regression setting. Other regression methods should also be used for further study. 

In future, we need to collect more data about county-level intervention to measure the start dates and end dates of the policies more accurately. Also, we can examine other mobility signals available in the Dephi API.
