# Mobility, Government Intervention, and Potential Confounders

## Goals and Research Questions

Mobility is one of the potential factors in contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Our goal is to estimate the effect of state-wide policies on mobility signals at a county-level in this work to answer the following questions: 

  * Do mobility signals decrease more because of the governemnt interventions or public reaction to case counts?

  * Once we can measure the effects of governemnt interventions on mobility, can we rank the effectiveness of the interventions at a county level?

  * Can we characterize different counties based on the known effects of the governemnt interventions on mobility?

  * Do mandatory policies seem to be more effective than recommended policies in reducing mobility?


## Deliverables

* Lag analysis for case count signals, doctor visits on mobility across states [See 00_initial_exploration.md](reports/00_initial_exploration.md)

* Mobility signals across states under different interventions [See 00_initial_exploration.md](reports/00_initial_exploration.md)

* ANOVA and multiple comparisons [See 01_regression_ANOVA.md](reports/01_regression_ANOVA.md)

  * Analyze the difference in mean mobility among interventions

* Regression discontinuity design to measure the effects of interventions on mobility. [See 02_estimating_effect_of_intervention_via_RDD.md](reports/02_estimating_effect_of_intervention_via_RDD.md)
