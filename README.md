# Delphi Statistical Analyses

*Statistical analyses for Delphi COVID-19 Response Team*

This is the home for short term projects that explore the data within Delphi.  See [the following document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a47TPdhvGPXWkD6hrX_16hhmcTaIMVUxIs57UZ5MOh4/edit?usp=sharing) for descriptions and recommendations for data analysis projects.  Each "chapter" in the [TOC](#table-of-contents) below corresponds to a DAP and look at [usage](#usage) for instructions.

## Usage

To add a project, such as a DAP, to this repository, simply,
- create a branch of the same name as your project such as `dv_correlation` for doctor visit correlation diagnosis, work on this branch until the review phase.
- add a directory with a README containing: title, authors, abstract, conclusions, table of contents, reproducibility instructions
- add code folder with makefile for reproduction
- add notebook folder with jupyter/Rmd notebooks
- add data folder with .gitignore
- add your project to the TOC
- when completed make a PR and assign a reviewer (typically a senior statistician), think of this as the review phase for a publication
