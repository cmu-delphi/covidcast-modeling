# Delphi Statistical Analyses

*Statistical analyses for Delphi COVID-19 Response Team*

This is the home for short term projects such as
- one-off statistical analyses, Data Analysis Projects (DAP)
- modeling projects with shorter time window 
- analyses can be converted into blog posts and reports

## Usage

To add a project, such as a DAP, to this repository, simply,
- add a directory with a README containing: title, authors, abstract, conclusions, table of contents, reproducibility instructions
- add code folder with makefile for reproduction
- add notebook folder with jupyter/Rmd notebooks
- add data folder with .gitignore
- add your project to the TOC
- when completed make a PR and assign a reviewer, think of this as the editing phase for a publication
