We do see a peak in visits around May, but since June it looks somewhat flat. The decline at the end can be attributed to backfill. AK is somewhat anomalous. The only other concern would be data issues over at HSP, which is not out of question, but not possible to \"fix\" at our end.\n",

Since it's all the indicators, the culprit is likely the Cases signal itself.  But why exactly?  Is it the rising then falling number of cases?  Does the definition of \"Active\" county (to be included in the correlation) change across dates?\n",

    "I think the spike in May and drop in June is due to people going back to the doctor after delaying non-essential visits. In May, the number of CLI visits increased while the %CLI decreased. So I will propose Thought 3: The number of CLI visits increases in May, which truly is correlated with case counts. Because of the spike in non-essential visits in May, %CLI decreases, which then decreases the correlation between case counts and the DV signal. In June, the number of CLI is much less than it was in May, but %CLI is actually higher, again decreasing the correlation between case counts and the DV signal.\n",
